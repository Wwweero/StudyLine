## Usage Instructions  

1. Start the Program: Run the script to access the main menu.  
2. Choose an Option:  
   - Add a new flashcard (Option 1).  
   - View all flashcards (Option 2).  
   - Delete flashcards (Option 3).  
   - Study mode (Option 4).  
   - Test mode (Option 5).  
   - Exit the program (Option 6).

    I suggest starting with Option 1 as there are no saved flashcards (see example usage on       how to add a flashacard).

3. **Storage**:  
   Flashcards are automatically saved in a file named `flashcards.json` in the same directory. You can edit this file manually if needed.
